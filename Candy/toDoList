Okay this is more of an Idea list/Deamand list XD

- Create a background package, each background file will be created with SKSpriteNodes and then added to the scene.
- Create a foreground package, this will contain things such as front animations e.g. sweet tap animations.
- Create a person/player package, this will have the customisation of the player.
- How I want the scene files to be structures like:
    - Scene:  + Background Classes
              + Foreground Classes
              + Person Class
              + Gui Overlay Class
              + Data Classes (e.g. Money and Time)

- Should have like constant animations happening in the background, for example in my other app I had clouds always moving, makes it less static!
